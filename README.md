# Python-Challenge
# I am behind in certain concepts but trying to understand through Xpert Learning Tool and also recieved instructor help for an overall idea of how the code needs to be structured. 
# I could not get tutoring sorted out because of issues with my portal so I will be trying to resubmit for issues in my assignment 
# I recieved help from Carlos as well as Xpert learning to understand that my dev environment was having a pandas installation issue which I then solved by creating a new environment and running the script from there.
