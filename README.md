# Python-Challenge
# I am behind in certain concepts but trying to understand through Xpert Learning Tool and also recieved instructor help for an overall idea of how the code needs to be structured. 
# I could not get tutoring sorted out because of issues with my portal so I will be trying to resubmit for issues in my assignment 
# I recieved help from Carlos as well as Xpert learning to understand that my dev environment was having a pandas installation issue which I then solved by creating a new environment and running the script from there. 
After speaking to the TA I understood I needed to correctly use csv for complete my challenge and I need to be more aware about my indents because they caused a lot of errors for me while running my script.
I also came across an error for my file path where the csv file was not being identified in the script and I am still unsure of why I got that error - it seemed to go away on it's own after I corrected a few indents in the script but I am unsure of how that can impact it.
